You may be able to add your desired feature with a custom command. Check out the examples here: https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/wiki/Custom-Commands-Compendium

If a custom command does what you want but you still want to see the feature built-in to lazygit, feel free to paste the custom command into the issue to help us better understand the functionality you want.

We also encourage you to put up a PR yourself! Who cares if you've never written Go before, neither did any of the existing contributors before their first lazygit PR! Check out the PR tutorial here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kNavnhzZHtk&ab_channel=JesseDuffield
