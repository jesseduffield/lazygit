// Step returns the first grapheme cluster (user-perceived character) found in
// the given byte slice. It also returns information about the boundary between
// that grapheme cluster and the one following it as well as the monospace width
// of the grapheme cluster. There are three types of boundary information: word
// boundaries, sentence boundaries, and line breaks. This function is therefore
// a combination of [FirstGraphemeCluster], [FirstWord], [FirstSentence], and
// [FirstLineSegment].
//
// The "boundaries" return value can be evaluated as follows:
//
//   - boundaries&MaskWord != 0: The boundary is a word boundary.
//   - boundaries&MaskWord == 0: The boundary is not a word boundary.
//   - boundaries&MaskSentence != 0: The boundary is a sentence boundary.
//   - boundaries&MaskSentence == 0: The boundary is not a sentence boundary.
//   - boundaries&MaskLine == LineDontBreak: You must not break the line at the
//     boundary.
//   - boundaries&MaskLine == LineMustBreak: You must break the line at the
//     boundary.
//   - boundaries&MaskLine == LineCanBreak: You may or may not break the line at
//     the boundary.
//   - boundaries >> ShiftWidth: The width of the grapheme cluster for most
//     monospace fonts where a value of 1 represents one character cell.
//
// This function can be called continuously to extract all grapheme clusters
// from a byte slice, as illustrated in the examples below.
//
// If you don't know which state to pass, for example when calling the function
// for the first time, you must pass -1. For consecutive calls, pass the state
// and rest slice returned by the previous call.
//
// The "rest" slice is the sub-slice of the original byte slice "b" starting
// after the last byte of the identified grapheme cluster. If the length of the
// "rest" slice is 0, the entire byte slice "b" has been processed. The
// "cluster" byte slice is the sub-slice of the input slice containing the
// first identified grapheme cluster.
//
// Given an empty byte slice "b", the function returns nil values.
//
// While slightly less convenient than using the Graphemes class, this function
// has much better performance and makes no allocations. It lends itself well to
// large byte slices.
//
// Note that in accordance with [UAX #14 LB3], the final segment will end with
// a mandatory line break (boundaries&MaskLine == LineMustBreak). You can choose
// to ignore this by checking if the length of the "rest" slice is 0 and calling
// [HasTrailingLineBreak] or [HasTrailingLineBreakInString] on the last rune.
