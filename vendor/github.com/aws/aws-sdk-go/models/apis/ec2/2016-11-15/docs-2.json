Available snapshots include public snapshots available for use by any AWS account, private snapshots that you own, and private snapshots owned by another AWS account for which you've been given explicit create volume permissions.</p> <p>The create volume permissions fall into the following categories:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <i>public</i>: The owner of the snapshot granted create volume permissions for the snapshot to the <code>all</code> group. All AWS accounts have create volume permissions for these snapshots.</p> </li> <li> <p> <i>explicit</i>: The owner of the snapshot granted create volume permissions to a specific AWS account.</p> </li> <li> <p> <i>implicit</i>: An AWS account has implicit create volume permissions for all snapshots it owns.</p> </li> </ul> <p>The list of snapshots returned can be modified by specifying snapshot IDs, snapshot owners, or AWS accounts with create volume permissions. If no options are specified, Amazon EC2 returns all snapshots for which you have create volume permissions.</p> <p>If you specify one or more snapshot IDs, only snapshots that have the specified IDs are returned. If you specify an invalid snapshot ID, an error is returned. If you specify a snapshot ID for which you do not have access, it is not included in the returned results.</p> <p>If you specify one or more snapshot owners using the <code>OwnerIds</code> option, only snapshots from the specified owners and for which you have access are returned. The results can include the AWS account IDs of the specified owners, <code>amazon</code> for snapshots owned by Amazon, or <code>self</code> for snapshots that you own.</p> <p>If you specify a list of restorable users, only snapshots with create snapshot permissions for those users are returned. You can specify AWS account IDs (if you own the snapshots), <code>self</code> for snapshots for which you own or have explicit permissions, or <code>all</code> for public snapshots.</p> <p>If you are describing a long list of snapshots, you can paginate the output to make the list more manageable. The <code>MaxResults</code> parameter sets the maximum number of results returned in a single page. If the list of results exceeds your <code>MaxResults</code> value, then that number of results is returned along with a <code>NextToken</code> value that can be passed to a subsequent <code>DescribeSnapshots</code> request to retrieve the remaining results.</p> <p>For more information about EBS snapshots, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EBSSnapshots.html\">Amazon EBS Snapshots</a> in the <i>Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide</i>.</p>",

    "DescribeVolumeStatus": "<p>Describes the status of the specified volumes. Volume status provides the result of the checks performed on your volumes to determine events that can impair the performance of your volumes. The performance of a volume can be affected if an issue occurs on the volume's underlying host. If the volume's underlying host experiences a power outage or system issue, after the system is restored, there could be data inconsistencies on the volume. Volume events notify you if this occurs. Volume actions notify you if any action needs to be taken in response to the event.</p> <p>The <code>DescribeVolumeStatus</code> operation provides the following information about the specified volumes:</p> <p> <i>Status</i>: Reflects the current status of the volume. The possible values are <code>ok</code>, <code>impaired</code> , <code>warning</code>, or <code>insufficient-data</code>. If all checks pass, the overall status of the volume is <code>ok</code>. If the check fails, the overall status is <code>impaired</code>. If the status is <code>insufficient-data</code>, then the checks may still be taking place on your volume at the time. We recommend that you retry the request. For more information about volume status, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/monitoring-volume-status.html\">Monitoring the Status of Your Volumes</a> in the <i>Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide</i>.</p> <p> <i>Events</i>: Reflect the cause of a volume status and may require you to take action. For example, if your volume returns an <code>impaired</code> status, then the volume event might be <code>potential-data-inconsistency</code>. This means that your volume has been affected by an issue with the underlying host, has all I/O operations disabled, and may have inconsistent data.</p> <p> <i>Actions</i>: Reflect the actions you may have to take in response to an event. For example, if the status of the volume is <code>impaired</code> and the volume event shows <code>potential-data-inconsistency</code>, then the action shows <code>enable-volume-io</code>. This means that you may want to enable the I/O operations for the volume by calling the <a>EnableVolumeIO</a> action and then check the volume for data consistency.</p> <p>Volume status is based on the volume status checks, and does not reflect the volume state. Therefore, volume status does not indicate volumes in the <code>error</code> state (for example, when a volume is incapable of accepting I/O.)</p>",

If a <code>KmsKeyId</code> is specified, the <code>Encrypted</code> flag must also be set. </p> <p>The CMK identifier may be provided in any of the following formats: </p> <ul> <li> <p>Key ID</p> </li> <li> <p>Key alias</p> </li> <li> <p>ARN using key ID. The ID ARN contains the <code>arn:aws:kms</code> namespace, followed by the region of the CMK, the AWS account ID of the CMK owner, the <code>key</code> namespace, and then the CMK ID. For example, arn:aws:kms:<i>us-east-1</i>:<i>012345678910</i>:key/<i>abcd1234-a123-456a-a12b-a123b4cd56ef</i>. </p> </li> <li> <p>ARN using key alias. The alias ARN contains the <code>arn:aws:kms</code> namespace, followed by the region of the CMK, the AWS account ID of the CMK owner, the <code>alias</code> namespace, and then the CMK alias. For example, arn:aws:kms:<i>us-east-1</i>:<i>012345678910</i>:alias/<i>ExampleAlias</i>. </p> </li> </ul> <p>AWS parses <code>KmsKeyId</code> asynchronously, meaning that the action you call may appear to complete even though you provided an invalid identifier.
