After it creates the endpoint, it sets the status to <code>InService</code>. Amazon SageMaker can then process incoming requests for inferences. To check the status of an endpoint, use the <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/API_DescribeEndpoint.html\">DescribeEndpoint</a> API.</p> <p>For an example, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/ex1.html\">Exercise 1: Using the K-Means Algorithm Provided by Amazon SageMaker</a>. </p> <p>If any of the models hosted at this endpoint get model data from an Amazon S3 location, Amazon SageMaker uses AWS Security Token Service to download model artifacts from the S3 path you provided. AWS STS is activated in your IAM user account by default. If you previously deactivated AWS STS for a region, you need to reactivate AWS STS for that region. For more information, see <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_enable-regions.html\">Activating and Deactivating AWS STS i an AWS Region</a> in the <i>AWS Identity and Access Management User Guide</i>.</p>",

Each <code>ProductionVariant</code> parameter also describes the resources that you want Amazon SageMaker to provision. This includes the number and type of ML compute instances to deploy. </p> <p>If you are hosting multiple models, you also assign a <code>VariantWeight</code> to specify how much traffic you want to allocate to each model. For example, suppose that you want to host two models, A and B, and you assign traffic weight 2 for model A and 1 for model B. Amazon SageMaker distributes two-thirds of the traffic to Model A, and one-third to model B. </p>",
    "CreateHyperParameterTuningJob": "<p>Starts a hyperparameter tuning job. A hyperparameter tuning job finds the best version of a model by running many training jobs on your dataset using the algorithm you choose and values for hyperparameters within ranges that you specify.

It can include employees, contractors, and outside experts. Use a private workforce when want the data to stay within your organization or when a specific set of skills is required.</p> </li> <li> <p>One or more vendors that you select from the AWS Marketplace. Vendors provide expertise in specific areas. </p> </li> <li> <p>The Amazon Mechanical Turk workforce. This is the largest workforce, but it should only be used for public data or data that has been stripped of any personally identifiable information.</p> </li> </ul> <p>You can also use <i>automated data labeling</i> to reduce the number of data objects that need to be labeled by a human. Automated data labeling uses <i>active learning</i> to determine if a data object can be labeled by machine or if it needs to be sent to a human worker. For more information, see <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/sms-automated-labeling.html\">Using Automated Data Labeling</a>.</p> <p>The data objects to be labeled are contained in an Amazon S3 bucket.

Amazon SageMaker then deploys all of the containers that you defined for the model in the hosting environment. </p> <p>To run a batch transform using your model, you start a job with the <code>CreateTransformJob</code> API. Amazon SageMaker uses your model and your dataset to get inferences which are then saved to a specified S3 location.</p> <p>In the <code>CreateModel</code> request, you must define a container with the <code>PrimaryContainer</code> parameter.</p> <p>In the request, you also provide an IAM role that Amazon SageMaker can assume to access model artifacts and docker image for deployment on ML compute hosting instances or for batch transform jobs. In addition, you also use the IAM role to manage permissions the inference code needs. For example, if the inference code access any other AWS resources, you grant necessary permissions via this role.</p>",
    "CreateModelPackage": "<p>Creates a model package that you can use to create Amazon SageMaker models or list on AWS Marketplace. Buyers can subscribe to model packages listed on AWS Marketplace to create models in Amazon SageMaker.</p> <p>To create a model package by specifying a Docker container that contains your inference code and the Amazon S3 location of your model artifacts, provide values for <code>InferenceSpecification</code>. To create a model from an algorithm resource that you created or subscribed to in AWS Marketplace, provide a value for <code>SourceAlgorithmSpecification</code>.</p>",
    "CreateNotebookInstance": "<p>Creates an Amazon SageMaker notebook instance. A notebook instance is a machine learning (ML) compute instance running on a Jupyter notebook. </p> <p>In a <code>CreateNotebookInstance</code> request, specify the type of ML compute instance that you want to run. Amazon SageMaker launches the instance, installs common libraries that you can use to explore datasets for model training, and attaches an ML storage volume to the notebook instance. </p> <p>Amazon SageMaker also provides a set of example notebooks. Each notebook demonstrates how to use Amazon SageMaker with a specific algorithm or with a machine learning framework. </p> <p>After receiving the request, Amazon SageMaker does the following:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Creates a network interface in the Amazon SageMaker VPC.</p> </li> <li> <p>(Option) If you specified <code>SubnetId</code>, Amazon SageMaker creates a network interface in your own VPC, which is inferred from the subnet ID that you provide in the input. When creating this network interface, Amazon SageMaker attaches the security group that you specified in the request to the network interface that it creates in your VPC.</p> </li> <li> <p>Launches an EC2 instance of the type specified in the request in the Amazon SageMaker VPC. If you specified <code>SubnetId</code> of your VPC, Amazon SageMaker specifies both network interfaces when launching this instance. This enables inbound traffic from your own VPC to the notebook instance, assuming that the security groups allow it.</p> </li> </ol> <p>After creating the notebook instance, Amazon SageMaker returns its Amazon Resource Name (ARN).</p> <p>After Amazon SageMaker creates the notebook instance, you can connect to the Jupyter server and work in Jupyter notebooks. For example, you can write code to explore a dataset that you can use for model training, train a model, host models by creating Amazon SageMaker endpoints, and validate hosted models. </p> <p>For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/how-it-works.html\">How It Works</a>. </p>",

To restrict access, attach an IAM policy that denies access to this API unless the call comes from an IP address in the specified list to every AWS Identity and Access Management user, group, or role used to access the notebook instance. Use the <code>NotIpAddress</code> condition operator and the <code>aws:SourceIP</code> condition context key to specify the list of IP addresses that you want to have access to the notebook instance.
