Kubernetes is an open-source system for automating the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. </p> <p>Amazon EKS runs up-to-date versions of the open-source Kubernetes software, so you can use all the existing plugins and tooling from the Kubernetes community. Applications running on Amazon EKS are fully compatible with applications running on any standard Kubernetes environment, whether running in on-premises data centers or public clouds. This means that you can easily migrate any standard Kubernetes application to Amazon EKS without any code modification required.</p>",
  "operations": {
    "CreateCluster": "<p>Creates an Amazon EKS control plane. </p> <p>The Amazon EKS control plane consists of control plane instances that run the Kubernetes software, like <code>etcd</code> and the API server. The control plane runs in an account managed by AWS, and the Kubernetes API is exposed via the Amazon EKS API server endpoint. Each Amazon EKS cluster control plane is single-tenant and unique, and runs on its own set of Amazon EC2 instances.</p> <p>The cluster control plane is provisioned across multiple Availability Zones and fronted by an Elastic Load Balancing Network Load Balancer. Amazon EKS also provisions elastic network interfaces in your VPC subnets to provide connectivity from the control plane instances to the worker nodes (for example, to support <code>kubectl exec</code>, <code>logs</code>, and <code>proxy</code> data flows).</p> <p>Amazon EKS worker nodes run in your AWS account and connect to your cluster's control plane via the Kubernetes API server endpoint and a certificate file that is created for your cluster.</p> <p>You can use the <code>endpointPublicAccess</code> and <code>endpointPrivateAccess</code> parameters to enable or disable public and private access to your cluster's Kubernetes API server endpoint. By default, public access is enabled and private access is disabled. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/cluster-endpoint.html\">Amazon EKS Cluster Endpoint Access Control</a> in the <i> <i>Amazon EKS User Guide</i> </i>. </p> <p>You can use the <code>logging</code> parameter to enable or disable exporting the Kubernetes control plane logs for your cluster to CloudWatch Logs.
