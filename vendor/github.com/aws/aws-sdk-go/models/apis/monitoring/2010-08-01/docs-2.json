You can use CloudWatch to collect and track metrics, which are the variables you want to measure for your resources and applications.</p> <p>CloudWatch alarms send notifications or automatically change the resources you are monitoring based on rules that you define. For example, you can monitor the CPU usage and disk reads and writes of your Amazon EC2 instances. Then, use this data to determine whether you should launch additional instances to handle increased load. You can also use this data to stop under-used instances to save money.</p> <p>In addition to monitoring the built-in metrics that come with AWS, you can monitor your own custom metrics. With CloudWatch, you gain system-wide visibility into resource utilization, application performance, and operational health.</p>",

    "GetMetricData": "<p>You can use the <code>GetMetricData</code> API to retrieve as many as 100 different metrics in a single request, with a total of as many as 100,800 datapoints. You can also optionally perform math expressions on the values of the returned statistics, to create new time series that represent new insights into your data. For example, using Lambda metrics, you could divide the Errors metric by the Invocations metric to get an error rate time series. For more information about metric math expressions, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/using-metric-math.html#metric-math-syntax\">Metric Math Syntax and Functions</a> in the <i>Amazon CloudWatch User Guide</i>.</p> <p>Calls to the <code>GetMetricData</code> API have a different pricing structure than calls to <code>GetMetricStatistics</code>.

    "GetMetricStatistics": "<p>Gets statistics for the specified metric.</p> <p>The maximum number of data points returned from a single call is 1,440. If you request more than 1,440 data points, CloudWatch returns an error. To reduce the number of data points, you can narrow the specified time range and make multiple requests across adjacent time ranges, or you can increase the specified period. Data points are not returned in chronological order.</p> <p>CloudWatch aggregates data points based on the length of the period that you specify. For example, if you request statistics with a one-hour period, CloudWatch aggregates all data points with time stamps that fall within each one-hour period. Therefore, the number of values aggregated by CloudWatch is larger than the number of data points returned.</p> <p>CloudWatch needs raw data points to calculate percentile statistics. If you publish data using a statistic set instead, you can only retrieve percentile statistics for this data if one of the following conditions is true:</p> <ul> <li> <p>The SampleCount value of the statistic set is 1.</p> </li> <li> <p>The Min and the Max values of the statistic set are equal.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Percentile statistics are not available for metrics when any of the metric values are negative numbers.</p> <p>Amazon CloudWatch retains metric data as follows:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Data points with a period of less than 60 seconds are available for 3 hours.

You could also retrieve images regularly, such as every minute, and create your own custom live dashboard.</p> <p>The graph you retrieve can include all CloudWatch metric graph features, including metric math and horizontal and vertical annotations.</p> <p>There is a limit of 20 transactions per second for this API. Each <code>GetMetricWidgetImage</code> action has the following limits:</p> <ul> <li> <p>As many as 100 metrics in the graph.</p> </li> <li> <p>Up to 100 KB uncompressed payload.</p> </li> </ul>",

To copy an existing dashboard using the console, you can load the dashboard and then use the View/edit source command in the Actions menu to display the JSON block for that dashboard. Another way to copy a dashboard is to use <code>GetDashboard</code>, and then use the data returned within <code>DashboardBody</code> as the template for the new dashboard when you call <code>PutDashboard</code>.</p> <p>When you create a dashboard with <code>PutDashboard</code>, a good practice is to add a text widget at the top of the dashboard with a message that the dashboard was created by script and should not be changed in the console.

    "PutMetricAlarm": "<p>Creates or updates an alarm and associates it with the specified metric or metric math expression.</p> <p>When this operation creates an alarm, the alarm state is immediately set to <code>INSUFFICIENT_DATA</code>.

However, if you are later granted the required permissions, the alarm actions that you created earlier are performed.</p> <p>If you are using an IAM role (for example, an EC2 instance profile), you cannot stop or terminate the instance using alarm actions. However, you can still see the alarm state and perform any other actions such as Amazon SNS notifications or Auto Scaling policies.</p> <p>If you are using temporary security credentials granted using AWS STS, you cannot stop or terminate an EC2 instance using alarm actions.</p> <p>The first time you create an alarm in the AWS Management Console, the CLI, or by using the PutMetricAlarm API, CloudWatch creates the necessary service-linked role for you. The service-linked role is called <code>AWSServiceRoleForCloudWatchEvents</code>.

    "PutMetricData": "<p>Publishes metric data points to Amazon CloudWatch. CloudWatch associates the data points with the specified metric. If the specified metric does not exist, CloudWatch creates the metric. When CloudWatch creates a metric, it can take up to fifteen minutes for the metric to appear in calls to <a>ListMetrics</a>.</p> <p>You can publish either individual data points in the <code>Value</code> field, or arrays of values and the number of times each value occurred during the period by using the <code>Values</code> and <code>Counts</code> fields in the <code>MetricDatum</code> structure. Using the <code>Values</code> and <code>Counts</code> method enables you to publish up to 150 values per metric with one <code>PutMetricData</code> request, and supports retrieving percentile statistics on this data.</p> <p>Each <code>PutMetricData</code> request is limited to 40 KB in size for HTTP POST requests. You can send a payload compressed by gzip. Each request is also limited to no more than 20 different metrics.</p> <p>Although the <code>Value</code> parameter accepts numbers of type <code>Double</code>, CloudWatch rejects values that are either too small or too large. Values must be in the range of 8.515920e-109 to 1.174271e+108 (Base 10) or 2e-360 to 2e360 (Base 2). In addition, special values (for example, NaN, +Infinity, -Infinity) are not supported.</p> <p>You can use up to 10 dimensions per metric to further clarify what data the metric collects. Each dimension consists of a Name and Value pair. For more information about specifying dimensions, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/publishingMetrics.html\">Publishing Metrics</a> in the <i>Amazon CloudWatch User Guide</i>.</p> <p>Data points with time stamps from 24 hours ago or longer can take at least 48 hours to become available for <a>GetMetricData</a> or <a>GetMetricStatistics</a> from the time they are submitted.</p> <p>CloudWatch needs raw data points to calculate percentile statistics. If you publish data using a statistic set instead, you can only retrieve percentile statistics for this data if one of the following conditions is true:</p> <ul> <li> <p>The <code>SampleCount</code> value of the statistic set is 1 and <code>Min</code>, <code>Max</code>, and <code>Sum</code> are all equal.</p> </li> <li> <p>The <code>Min</code> and <code>Max</code> are equal, and <code>Sum</code> is equal to <code>Min</code> multiplied by <code>SampleCount</code>.</p> </li> </ul>",
    "SetAlarmState": "<p>Temporarily sets the state of an alarm for testing purposes. When the updated state differs from the previous value, the action configured for the appropriate state is invoked. For example, if your alarm is configured to send an Amazon SNS message when an alarm is triggered, temporarily changing the alarm state to <code>ALARM</code> sends an SNS message. The alarm returns to its actual state (often within seconds).

If you specify a new tag key for the resource, this tag is appended to the list of tags associated with the resource.
