// Package gitignore implements matching file system paths to gitignore patterns that
// can be automatically read from a git repository tree in the order of definition
// priorities. It support all pattern formats as specified in the original gitignore
// documentation, copied below:
//
//   Pattern format
//   ==============
//
//		- A blank line matches no files, so it can serve as a separator for readability.
//
//		- A line starting with # serves as a comment. Put a backslash ("\") in front of
//		  the first hash for patterns that begin with a hash.
//
//		- Trailing spaces are ignored unless they are quoted with backslash ("\").
//
//		- An optional prefix "!" which negates the pattern; any matching file excluded
//		  by a previous pattern will become included again. It is not possible to
//		  re-include a file if a parent directory of that file is excluded.
//		  Git doesnâ€™t list excluded directories for performance reasons, so
//		  any patterns on contained files have no effect, no matter where they are
//		  defined. Put a backslash ("\") in front of the first "!" for patterns
//		  that begin with a literal "!", for example, "\!important!.txt".
//
//		- If the pattern ends with a slash, it is removed for the purpose of the
//		  following description, but it would only find a match with a directory.
//		  In other words, foo/ will match a directory foo and paths underneath it,
//		  but will not match a regular file or a symbolic link foo (this is consistent
//		  with the way how pathspec works in general in Git).
//
//		- If the pattern does not contain a slash /, Git treats it as a shell glob
//		  pattern and checks for a match against the pathname relative to the location
//		  of the .gitignore file (relative to the toplevel of the work tree if not
//		  from a .gitignore file).
//
//		- Otherwise, Git treats the pattern as a shell glob suitable for consumption
//		  by fnmatch(3) with the FNM_PATHNAME flag: wildcards in the pattern will
//		  not match a / in the pathname. For example, "Documentation/*.html" matches
//		  "Documentation/git.html" but not "Documentation/ppc/ppc.html" or
//		  "tools/perf/Documentation/perf.html".
//
//		- A leading slash matches the beginning of the pathname. For example,
//		  "/*.c" matches "cat-file.c" but not "mozilla-sha1/sha1.c".
//
//		Two consecutive asterisks ("**") in patterns matched against full pathname
//		may have special meaning:
//
//		- A leading "**" followed by a slash means match in all directories.
//		  For example, "**/foo" matches file or directory "foo" anywhere, the same as
//		  pattern "foo". "**/foo/bar" matches file or directory "bar"
//		  anywhere that is directly under directory "foo".
//
//		- A trailing "/**" matches everything inside. For example, "abc/**" matches
//		  all files inside directory "abc", relative to the location of the
//		  .gitignore file, with infinite depth.
//
//		- A slash followed by two consecutive asterisks then a slash matches
//		  zero or more directories. For example, "a/**/b" matches "a/b", "a/x/b",
//		  "a/x/y/b" and so on.
//
//		- Other consecutive asterisks are considered invalid.
