# User Config

Default path for the global config file:

- Linux: `~/.config/lazygit/config.yml`
- MacOS: `~/Library/Application\ Support/lazygit/config.yml`
- Windows: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\lazygit\config.yml` (default location, but it will also be found in `%APPDATA%\lazygit\config.yml`

For old installations (slightly embarrassing: I didn't realise at the time that you didn't need to supply a vendor name to the path so I just used my name):

- Linux: `~/.config/jesseduffield/lazygit/config.yml`
- MacOS: `~/Library/Application\ Support/jesseduffield/lazygit/config.yml`
- Windows: `%APPDATA%\jesseduffield\lazygit\config.yml`

If you want to change the config directory:

- MacOS: `export XDG_CONFIG_HOME="$HOME/.config"`

In addition to the global config file you can create repo-specific config files in `<repo>/.git/lazygit.yml`. Settings in these files override settings in the global config file. In addition, files called `.lazygit.yml` in any of the parent directories of a repo will also be loaded; this can be useful if you have settings that you want to apply to a group of repositories.

JSON schema is available for `config.yml` so that IntelliSense in Visual Studio Code (completion and error checking) is automatically enabled when the [YAML Red Hat][yaml] extension is installed. However, note that automatic schema detection only works if your config file is in one of the standard paths mentioned above. If you override the path to the file, you can still make IntelliSense work by adding

```yaml
# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/master/schema/config.json
```

to the top of your config file or via [Visual Studio Code settings.json config][settings].

## Platform Defaults

### Windows

```yaml
os:
  open: 'start "" {{filename}}'
```

### Linux

```yaml
os:
  open: 'xdg-open {{filename}} >/dev/null'
```

### OSX

```yaml
os:
  open: 'open {{filename}}'
```

## Custom Command for Copying to and Pasting from Clipboard
```yaml
os:
  copyToClipboardCmd: ''
```
Specify an external command to invoke when copying to clipboard is requested. `{{text}` will be replaced by text to be copied. Default is to copy to system clipboard.

If you are working on a terminal that supports OSC52, the following command will let you take advantage of it:
```
os:
  copyToClipboardCmd: printf "\033]52;c;$(printf {{text}} | base64)\a" > /dev/tty
```

A custom command for reading from the clipboard can be set using
```yaml
os:
  readFromClipboardCmd: ''
```
It is used, for example, when pasting a commit message into the commit message panel. The command is supposed to output the clipboard content to stdout.

## Configuring File Editing

There are two commands for opening files, `o` for "open" and `e` for "edit". `o` acts as if the file was double-clicked in the Finder/Explorer, so it also works for non-text files, whereas `e` opens the file in an editor. `e` can also jump to the right line in the file if you invoke it from the staging panel, for example.

To tell lazygit which editor to use for the `e` command, the easiest way to do that is to provide an editPreset config, e.g.

```yaml
os:
  editPreset: 'vscode'
```

Supported presets are `vim`, `nvim`, `nvim-remote`, `lvim`, `emacs`, `nano`, `micro`, `vscode`, `sublime`, `bbedit`, `kakoune`, `helix`, `xcode`, and `zed`. In many cases lazygit will be able to guess the right preset from your $(git config core.editor), or an environment variable such as $VISUAL or $EDITOR.

`nvim-remote` is an experimental preset for when you have invoked lazygit from within a neovim process, allowing lazygit to open the file from within the parent process rather than spawning a new one.

If for some reason you are not happy with the default commands from a preset, or there simply is no preset for your editor, you can customize the commands by setting the `edit`, `editAtLine`, and `editAtLineAndWait` options, e.g.:

```yaml
os:
  edit: 'myeditor {{filename}}'
  editAtLine: 'myeditor --line={{line}} {{filename}}'
  editAtLineAndWait: 'myeditor --block --line={{line}} {{filename}}'
  editInTerminal: true
  openDirInEditor: 'myeditor {{dir}}'
```

The `editInTerminal` option is used to decide whether lazygit needs to suspend itself to the background before calling the editor. It should really be named `suspend` because for some cases like when lazygit is opened from within a neovim session and you're using the `nvim-remote` preset, you're technically still in a terminal. Nonetheless we're sticking with the name `editInTerminal` for backwards compatibility.

Contributions of new editor presets are welcome; see the `getPreset` function in [`editor_presets.go`](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/blob/master/pkg/config/editor_presets.go).

## Overriding default config file location

To override the default config directory, use `CONFIG_DIR="$HOME/.config/lazygit"`. This directory contains the config file in addition to some other files lazygit uses to keep track of state across sessions.

To override the individual config file used, use the `--use-config-file` arg or the `LG_CONFIG_FILE` env var.

If you want to merge a specific config file into a more general config file, perhaps for the sake of setting some theme-specific options, you can supply a list of comma-separated config file paths, like so:

```sh
lazygit --use-config-file="$HOME/.base_lg_conf,$HOME/.light_theme_lg_conf"
or
LG_CONFIG_FILE="$HOME/.base_lg_conf,$HOME/.light_theme_lg_conf" lazygit

When the selected line gets close to the bottom of the window and you hit down-arrow, there's a feature called "scroll-off margin" that lets the view scroll a little earlier so that you can see a bit of what's coming in the direction that you are moving. This is controlled by the `gui.scrollOffMargin` setting (default: 2), so it keeps 2 lines below the selection visible as you scroll down. It can be set to 0 to scroll only when the selection reaches the bottom of the window.

That's the behavior when `gui.scrollOffBehavior` is set to "margin" (the default). If you set `gui.scrollOffBehavior` to "jump", then upon reaching the last line of a view and hitting down-arrow the view will scroll by half a page so that the selection ends up in the middle of the view. This may feel a little jarring because the cursor jumps around when continuously moving down, but it has the advantage that the view doesn't scroll as often.

This setting applies both to all list views (e.g. commits and branches etc), and to the staging view.

## Filtering

We have two ways to filter things, substring matching (the default) and fuzzy searching. With substring matching, the text you enter gets searched for verbatim (usually case-insensitive, except when your filter string contains uppercase letters, in which case we search case-sensitively). You can search for multiple non-contiguous substrings by separating them with spaces; for example, "int test" will match "integration-testing". All substrings have to match, but not necessarily in the given order.

Fuzzy searching is smarter in that it allows every letter of the filter string to match anywhere in the text (only in order though), assigning a weight to the quality of the match and sorting by that order. This has the advantage that it allows typing "clt" to match "commit_loader_test" (letters at the beginning of subwords get more weight); but it has the disadvantage that it tends to return lots of irrelevant results, especially with short filter strings.

## Color Attributes

For color attributes you can choose an array of attributes (with max one color attribute)
The available attributes are:

**Colors**

- black
- red
- green
- yellow
- blue
- magenta
- cyan
- white
- '#ff00ff'

**Modifiers**

- bold
- default
- reverse # useful for high-contrast
- underline
- strikethrough

## Highlighting the selected line

If you don't like the default behaviour of highlighting the selected line with a blue background, you can use the `selectedLineBgColor` key to customise the behaviour. If you just want to embolden the selected line (this was the original default), you can do the following:

```yaml
gui:
  theme:
    selectedLineBgColor:
      - default
```

You can also use the reverse attribute like so:

```yaml
gui:
  theme:
    selectedLineBgColor:
      - reverse
```

## Custom Author Color

Lazygit will assign a random color for every commit author in the commits pane by default.

You can customize the color in case you're not happy with the randomly assigned one:

```yaml
gui:
  authorColors:
    'John Smith': 'red' # use red for John Smith
    'Alan Smithee': '#00ff00' # use green for Alan Smithee
```

You can use wildcard to set a unified color in case your are lazy to customize the color for every author or you just want a single color for all/other authors:

```yaml
gui:
  authorColors:
    # use red for John Smith
    'John Smith': 'red'
    # use blue for other authors
    '*': '#0000ff'
```

## Custom Branch Color

You can customize the color of branches based on the branch prefix:

```yaml
gui:
  branchColors:
    'docs': '#11aaff' # use a light blue for branches beginning with 'docs/'
```

## Example Coloring

## Display Nerd Fonts Icons

If you are using [Nerd Fonts](https://www.nerdfonts.com), you can display icons.

```yaml
gui:
  nerdFontsVersion: "3"
```

Supported versions are "2" and "3". The deprecated config `showIcons` sets the version to "2" for backwards compatibility.

## Keybindings

For all possible keybinding options, check [Custom_Keybindings.md](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/blob/master/docs/keybindings/Custom_Keybindings.md)

You can disable certain key bindings by specifying `<disabled>`.

```yaml
keybinding:
  universal:
    edit: <disabled> # disable 'edit file'
```

### Example Keybindings For Colemak Users

```yaml
keybinding:
  universal:
    prevItem-alt: 'u'
    nextItem-alt: 'e'
    prevBlock-alt: 'n'
    nextBlock-alt: 'i'
    nextMatch: '='
    prevMatch: '-'
    new: 'k'
    edit: 'o'
    openFile: 'O'
    scrollUpMain-alt1: 'U'
    scrollDownMain-alt1: 'E'
    scrollUpMain-alt2: '<c-u>'
    scrollDownMain-alt2: '<c-e>'
    undo: 'l'
    redo: '<c-r>'
    diffingMenu: 'M'
    filteringMenu: '<c-f>'
  files:
    ignoreFile: 'I'
  commits:
    moveDownCommit: '<c-e>'
    moveUpCommit: '<c-u>'
  branches:
    viewGitFlowOptions: 'I'
    setUpstream: 'U'
```

## Custom pull request URLs

Some git provider setups (e.g. on-premises GitLab) can have distinct URLs for git-related calls and the web interface/API itself. To work with those, Lazygit needs to know where it needs to create the pull request. You can do so on your `config.yml` file using the following syntax:

```yaml
services:
  '<gitDomain>': '<provider>:<webDomain>'
```

Where:

- `gitDomain` stands for the domain used by git itself (i.e. the one present on clone URLs), e.g. `git.work.com`
- `provider` is one of `github`, `bitbucket`, `bitbucketServer`, `azuredevops`, `gitlab` or `gitea`
- `webDomain` is the URL where your git service exposes a web interface and APIs, e.g. `gitservice.work.com`

## Predefined commit message prefix

In situations where certain naming pattern is used for branches and commits, pattern can be used to populate commit message with prefix that is parsed from the branch name.

Example:

- Branch name: feature/AB-123
- Commit message: [AB-123] Adding feature

```yaml
git:
  commitPrefix:
    pattern: "^\\w+\\/(\\w+-\\w+).*"
    replace: '[$1] '
```

If you want repository-specific prefixes, you can map them with `commitPrefixes`. If you have both `commitPrefixes` defined and an entry in `commitPrefixes` for the current repo, the `commitPrefixes` entry is given higher precedence. Repository folder names must be an exact match.

```yaml
git:
  commitPrefixes:
    my_project: # This is repository folder name
      pattern: "^\\w+\\/(\\w+-\\w+).*"
      replace: '[$1] '
```

## Predefined branch name prefix

In situations where certain naming pattern is used for branches, this can be used to populate new branch creation with a static prefix.

Example:

Some branches:
- jsmith/AB-123
- cwilson/AB-125

```yaml
git:
  branchPrefix: "firstlast/"
```

## Custom git log command

You can override the `git log` command that's used to render the log of the selected branch like so:

```
git:
  branchLogCmd: "git log --graph --color=always --abbrev-commit --decorate --date=relative --pretty=medium --oneline {{branchName}} --"
```

## Launching not in a repository behaviour

By default, when launching lazygit from a directory that is not a repository, you will be prompted to choose if you would like to initialize a repo. You can override this behaviour in the config with one of the following:

```yaml
# for default prompting behaviour
notARepository: 'prompt'
```

```yaml
# to skip and initialize a new repo
notARepository: 'create'
```

```yaml
# to skip without creating a new repo
notARepository: 'skip'
```

```yaml
# to exit immediately if run outside of the Git repository
notARepository: 'quit'
```
