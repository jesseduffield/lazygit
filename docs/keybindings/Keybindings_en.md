| `` r `` | Reword | Reword the selected commit's message. |
| `` R `` | Reword with editor |  |
| `` d `` | Drop | Drop the selected commit. This will remove the commit from the branch via a rebase. If the commit makes changes that later commits depend on, you may need to resolve merge conflicts. |
| `` e `` | Edit (start interactive rebase) | Edit the selected commit. Use this to start an interactive rebase from the selected commit. When already mid-rebase, this will mark the selected commit for editing, which means that upon continuing the rebase, the rebase will pause at the selected commit to allow you to make changes. |
| `` i `` | Start interactive rebase | Start an interactive rebase for the commits on your branch. This will include all commits from the HEAD commit down to the first merge commit or main branch commit.
If you would instead like to start an interactive rebase from the selected commit, press `e`. |
| `` p `` | Pick | Mark the selected commit to be picked (when mid-rebase). This means that the commit will be retained upon continuing the rebase. |

| `` V `` | Paste (cherry-pick) |  |

| `` A `` | Amend | Amend commit with staged changes. If the selected commit is the HEAD commit, this will perform `git commit --amend`. Otherwise the commit will be amended via a rebase. |
| `` a `` | Amend commit attribute | Set/Reset commit author or set co-author. |
| `` t `` | Revert | Create a revert commit for the selected commit, which applies the selected commit's changes in reverse. |
| `` T `` | Tag commit | Create a new tag pointing at the selected commit. You'll be prompted to enter a tag name and optional description. |
| `` <c-l> `` | View log options | View options for commit log e.g. changing sort order, hiding the git graph, showing the whole git graph. |
| `` <space> `` | Checkout | Checkout the selected commit as a detached HEAD. |
| `` y `` | Copy commit attribute to clipboard | Copy commit attribute to clipboard (e.g. hash, URL, diff, message, author). |
| `` o `` | Open commit in browser |  |
| `` n `` | Create new branch off of commit |  |
| `` g `` | Reset | View reset options (soft/mixed/hard) for resetting onto selected item. |
| `` C `` | Copy (cherry-pick) | Mark commit as copied. Then, within the local commits view, you can press `V` to paste (cherry-pick) the copied commit(s) into your checked out branch. At any time you can press `<esc>` to cancel the selection. |
