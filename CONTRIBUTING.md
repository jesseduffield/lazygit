# Contributing

â™¥ We love pull requests from everyone !

When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish
to make via issue, email, or any other method with the owners of this repository
before making a change.

## Codebase guide

[This doc](./docs/dev/Codebase_Guide.md) explains:
* what the different packages in the codebase are for
* where important files live
* important concepts in the code
* how the event loop works
* other useful information

## All code changes happen through Pull Requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively
welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `base`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've added code that need documentation, update the documentation.
4. Write a [good commit message](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html).
5. Issue that pull request!

Please do not raise pull request from your fork's `base` branch: make a feature branch instead.

If you've never written Go in your life, then join the club! `lazytask` was the maintainer's first Go program. Go is widely considered an easy-to-learn language, so if you're looking for an open source project to gain dev experience, you've come to the right place.

## Running in a VSCode dev container

If you want to spare yourself the hassle of setting up your dev environment yourself (i.e. installing Go, extensions, and extra tools), you can run the `lasytask` code in a VSCode dev container like so:

This requires that:
* you have docker installed
* you have the dev containers extension installed in VSCode

See [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers) for more info about dev containers.

## Running in a Github Codespace

If you want to start contributing to `lazytask` with the click of a button, you can open the `lazytask` codebase in a Codespace. First fork the repo, then click to create a codespace:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8456633/201500566-ffe9105d-6030-4cc7-a525-6570b0b413a2.png)

To run `lazytask` from within the integrated terminal, just go `go run main.go`

This allows you to contribute to `lasytask` without needing to install anything on your local machine. The Codespace has all the necessary tools and extensions pre-installed.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/lobes/lazytask/issues)

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/lobes/lazytask/issues/new); it's that easy!

## Go

This project is written in Go. Go is an opinionated language with strict idioms, but some of those idioms are a little extreme. Some things we do differently:

1. There is no shame in using `self` as a receiver name in a struct method. In fact we encourage it
2. There is no shame in prefixing an interface with 'I' instead of suffixing with 'er' when there are several methods on the interface.
3. If a struct implements an interface, we make it explicit with something like:

```go
var _ MyInterface = &MyStruct{}
```

This makes the intent clearer and means that if we fail to satisfy the interface we'll get an error in the file that needs fixing.

### Code Formatting

To check code formatting [gofumpt](https://pkg.go.dev/mvdan.cc/gofumpt#section-readme) (which is a bit stricter than [gofmt](https://pkg.go.dev/cmd/gofmt)) is used.

To run gofumpt from your terminal go:

```
go install mvdan.cc/gofumpt@latest && gofumpt -l -w .
```

## Programming Font

`lazytasks` uses [Comic Code Ligatures](https://tosche.net/fonts/comic-code).

TODO: make that last statement true

## Internationalisation

Boy that's a hard word to spell. Anyway, `lazytask` is translated into several languages within the pkg/i18n package. If you need to render text to the user, you should add a new field to the TranslationSet struct in `pkg/i18n/english.go` and add the actual content within the `EnglishTranslationSet()` method in the same file. Then you can access via `gui.Tr.YourNewText` (or `self.c.Tr.YourNewText`, etc). Although it is appreciated if you translate the text into other languages, it's not expected of you (google translate will likely do a bad job anyway!).

TODO: make that last statement true

Note, we use 'Sentence case' for everything (so no 'Title Case' or 'whatever-it's-called-when-there's-no-capital-letters-case')


## Debugging

The easiest way to debug lasytask is to have two terminal tabs open at once: one for running lasytask (via `go run main.go -debug` in the project root) and one for viewing lasytask's logs (which can be done via `go run main.go --logs` or just `lasytask --logs`).

From most places in the codebase you have access to a logger e.g. `gui.Log.Warn("blah")` or `self.c.Log.Warn("blah")`.

If you find that the existing logs are too noisy, you can set the log level with e.g. `LOG_LEVEL=warn go run main.go -debug` and then only use `Warn` logs yourself.

If you need to log from code in the vendor directory (e.g. the `gocui` package), you won't have access to the logger, but you can easily add logging support by setting the `lasytask_LOG_PATH` environment variable and using `logs.Global.Warn("blah")`. This is a global logger that's only intended for development purposes.

If you keep having to do some setup steps to reproduce an issue, read the Testing section below to see how to create an integration test by recording a lasytask session. It's pretty easy!

### VSCode debugger

If you want to trigger a debug session from VSCode, you can use the following snippet. Note that the `console` key is, at the time of writing, still an experimental feature.

```jsonc
// .vscode/launch.json
{
  "version": "0.2.0",
  "configurations": [
    {
      "name": "debug lasytask",
      "type": "go",
      "request": "launch",
      "mode": "auto",
      "program": "main.go",
      "args": ["--debug"],
      "console": "externalTerminal" // <-- you need this to actually see the lasytask UI in a window while debugging
    }
  ]
}
```

## Profiling

If you want to investigate what's contributing to CPU usage you can add the following to the top of the `main()` function in `main.go`

```go
import "runtime/pprof"

func main() {
	f, err := os.Create("cpu.prof")
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal("could not create CPU profile: ", err)
	}
	defer f.Close()
	if err := pprof.StartCPUProfile(f); err != nil {
		log.Fatal("could not start CPU profile: ", err)
	}
	defer pprof.StopCPUProfile()
	...
```

Then run lasytask, and afterwards, from your terminal, run:

```sh
go tool pprof --web cpu.prof
```

That should open an application which allows you to view the breakdown of CPU usage.

## Testing

`lasytask` has two kinds of tests: unit tests and integration tests. Unit tests go in files that end in `_test.go`, and are written in Go. For integration tests, see [here](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lasytask/blob/master/pkg/integration/README.md)

## Updating Gocui

Sometimes you will need to make a change in the gocui fork (https://github.com/jesseduffield/gocui). Gocui is the package responsible for rendering windows and handling user input. Here's the typical process to follow:

1. Make the changes in gocui inside lasytask's vendor directory so it's easy to test against lasytask
2. Copy the changes over to the actual gocui repo (clone it if you haven't already, and use the `awesome` branch, not `master`)
3. Raise a PR on the gocui repo with your changes
4. After that PR is merged, make a PR in lasytask bumping the gocui version. You can bump the version by running the following at the lasytask repo root:

```sh
./scripts/bump_gocui.sh
```

5. Raise a PR in lasytask with those changes

## Updating Lazycore

[Lazycore](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazycore) is a repo containing shared functionality between lasytask and lazydocker. Sometimes you will need to make a change to that repo and import the changes into lasytask. Similar to updating Gocui, here's what you do:

1. Make the changes in lazycore inside lasytask's vendor directory so it's easy to test against lasytask
2. Copy the changes over to the actual lazycore repo (clone it if you haven't already, and use the `master` branch)
3. Raise a PR on the lazycore repo with your changes
4. After that PR is merged, make a PR in lasytask bumping the lazycore version. You can bump the version by running the following at the lasytask repo root:

```sh
./scripts/bump_lazycore.sh
```

Or if you're using VSCode, there is a bump lazycore task you can find by going `cmd+shift+p` and typing 'Run task'

5. Raise a PR in lasytask with those changes
