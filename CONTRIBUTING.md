## So all code changes happen through Pull Requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively
welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've added code that need documentation, update the documentation.
4. Make sure your code follows the [effective go](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html) guidelines as much as possible.
5. Be sure to test your modifications.
6. Write a [good commit message](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html).
7. Issue that pull request!

## Updating Gocui

Sometimes you will need to make a change in the gocui fork (https://github.com/jesseduffield/gocui). Gocui is the package responsible for rending windows and handling user input. Here's the typical process to follow:

1. Make the changes in gocui inside the vendor directory so it's easy to test against lazygit
2. Copy the changes over to the actual gocui repo (clone it if you haven't already, and use the `awesome` branch, not `master`)
3. Raise a PR on the gocui repo with your changes
4. After that PR is merged, make a PR in lazygit bumping the gocui version. You can bump the version by running the following at the lazygit repo root:

```sh
./bump_gocui.sh
```

5. Raise a PR in lazygit with those changes
