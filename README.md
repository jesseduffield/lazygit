A simple terminal UI for git commands, written in Go with the [gocui](https://github.com/jroimartin/gocui "gocui") library.

Rant time: You've heard it before, git is _powerful_, but what good is that power when everything is so damn hard to do? Interactive rebasing requires you to edit a goddamn TODO file in your editor? *Are you kidding me?* To stage part of a file you need to use a command line program to step through each hunk and if a hunk can't be split down any further but contains code you don't want to stage, you have to edit an arcane patch file _by hand_? *Are you KIDDING me?!* Sometimes you get asked to stash your changes when switching branches only to realise that after you switch and unstash that there weren't even any conflicts and it would have been fine to just checkout the branch directly? *YOU HAVE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME!*

If you're a mere mortal like me and you're tired of hearing how powerful git is when in your daily life it's a powerful pain in your ass, lazygit might be for you.

## Installation

### Binary Releases

For Windows, Mac OS(10.12+) or Linux, you can download a binary release [here](../../releases).

### Homebrew

Normally the lazygit formula can be found in the Homebrew core but we suggest you tap our formula to get the frequently updated one. It works with Linux, too.

Tap:

```
brew install jesseduffield/lazygit/lazygit
```

Core:

```
brew install lazygit
```

### MacPorts

Latest version built from github releases.
Tap:

```
sudo port install lazygit
```

### Ubuntu

**Deprecated**: will no longer receive updates.

Packages for Ubuntu are available via [Launchpad PPA](https://launchpad.net/~lazygit-team).

```sh
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:lazygit-team/release
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install lazygit
```

### Void Linux

Packages for Void Linux are available in the distro repo

They follow upstream latest releases

```sh
sudo xbps-install -S lazygit
```

### Scoop (Windows)

You can install `lazygit` using [scoop](https://scoop.sh/). It's in the `extras` bucket:

```sh
# Add the extras bucket
scoop bucket add extras

# Install lazygit
scoop install lazygit
```

### Arch Linux

Packages for Arch Linux are available via pacman and AUR (Arch User Repository).

There are two packages. The stable one which is built with the latest release
and the git version which builds from the most recent commit.

- Stable: `sudo pacman -S lazygit`
- Development: <https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/lazygit-git/>

Instruction of how to install AUR content can be found here:
<https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Arch_User_Repository>

### Fedora and CentOS 7

Packages for Fedora and CentOS 7 are available via [Copr](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/atim/lazygit/) (Cool Other Package Repo).

```sh
sudo dnf copr enable atim/lazygit -y
sudo dnf install lazygit
```

### Solus Linux

```sh
sudo eopkg install lazygit
```

### Funtoo Linux

Funtoo Linux has an autogenerated lazygit package in [dev-kit](https://github.com/funtoo/dev-kit/tree/1.4-release/dev-vcs/lazygit):

```sh
sudo emerge dev-vcs/lazygit
```

### FreeBSD

```sh
pkg install lazygit
```


### Conda

Released versions are available for different platforms, see <https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/lazygit>

```sh
conda install -c conda-forge lazygit
```

### Go

```sh
go install github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit@latest
```

Please note:
If you get an error claiming that lazygit cannot be found or is not defined, you
may need to add `~/go/bin` to your \$PATH (MacOS/Linux), or `%HOME%\go\bin`
(Windows). Not to be mistaked for `C:\Go\bin` (which is for Go's own binaries,
not apps like Lazygit).

### Chocolatey (Windows)

You can install `lazygit` using [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/):

```sh
choco install lazygit
```

### Manual

You'll need to [install Go](https://golang.org/doc/install)

```
git clone https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit.git
cd lazygit
go install
```

You can also use `go run main.go` to compile and run in one go (pun definitely intended)

## Usage

Call `lazygit` in your terminal inside a git repository.

```sh
$ lazygit
```

If you want, you can
also add an alias for this with `echo "alias lg='lazygit'" >> ~/.zshrc` (or
whichever rc file you're using).

### Keybindings

You can check out the list of keybindings [here](/docs/keybindings).

### Changing Directory On Exit

If you change repos in lazygit and want your shell to change directory into that repo on exiting lazygit, add this to your `~/.zshrc` (or other rc file):

```
lg()
{
    export LAZYGIT_NEW_DIR_FILE=~/.lazygit/newdir

    lazygit "$@"

    if [ -f $LAZYGIT_NEW_DIR_FILE ]; then
            cd "$(cat $LAZYGIT_NEW_DIR_FILE)"
            rm -f $LAZYGIT_NEW_DIR_FILE > /dev/null
    fi
}
```

Then `source ~/.zshrc` and from now on when you call `lg` and exit you'll switch directories to whatever you were in inside lazyigt. To override this behaviour you can exit using `shift+Q` rather than just `q`.

### Undo/Redo

See the [docs](/docs/Undoing.md)

## Configuration

Check out the [configuration docs](docs/Config.md).

### Custom Pagers

See the [docs](docs/Custom_Pagers.md)

### Custom Commands

If lazygit is missing a feature, there's a good chance you can implement it yourself with a custom command!

See the [docs](docs/Custom_Command_Keybindings.md)
