## Elevator Pitch

Rant time: You've heard it before, git is _powerful_, but what good is that power when everything is so damn hard to do? Interactive rebasing requires you to edit a goddamn TODO file in your editor? _Are you kidding me?_ To stage part of a file you need to use a command line program to step through each hunk and if a hunk can't be split down any further but contains code you don't want to stage, you have to edit an arcane patch file _by hand_? _Are you KIDDING me?!_ Sometimes you get asked to stash your changes when switching branches only to realise that after you switch and unstash that there weren't even any conflicts and it would have been fine to just checkout the branch directly? _YOU HAVE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME!_

If you're a mere mortal like me and you're tired of hearing how powerful git is when in your daily life it's a powerful pain in your ass, lazygit might be for you.

Lazygit is not my fulltime job but it is a hefty part time job so if you want to support the project please consider [sponsoring me](https://github.com/sponsors/jesseduffield)

## Features

### Stage individual lines

Press space on the selected line to stage it, or press `v` to start selecting a range of lines. You can also press `a` to select the entirety of the current hunk.

![stage_lines](../assets/demo/stage_lines-compressed.gif)

### Interactive Rebase

Press `e` on a commit to start an interactive rebase on it: causing all above commits to become part of the TODO file. Then squash (`s`), fixup (`f`), drop (`d`), edit (`e`), move up (`ctrl+i`) or move down (`ctrl+j`) any of TODO commits, before continuing the rebase by bringing up the rebase options menu with `m` and then selecting `continue`.

You can also perform any these actions as a once-off (e.g. pressing `s` on a commit to squash it) without explicitly starting a rebase.

![interactive_rebase](../assets/demo/interactive_rebase-compressed.gif)

### Cherry-pick

Press `shift+c` on a commit to copy it and press `shift+v` to paste (cherry-pick) it.

![cherry_pick](../assets/demo/cherry_pick-compressed.gif)

### Bisect

Press `b` in the commits view to mark a commit as good/bad in order to begin a git bisect.

![bisect](../assets/demo/bisect-compressed.gif)

### Nuke the working tree

For when you really want to just get rid of anything that shows up when you run `git status` (and yes that includes dirty submodules) [kidpix style](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur7_A4JusMU), press `shift+d` to bring up the reset options menu and then select the 'nuke' option.

![Nuke working tree](../assets/demo/nuke_working_tree-compressed.gif)

### Amend an old commit

Pressing `shift+a` on any commit will amend that commit with the currently staged changes (running an interactive rebase in the background).

![amend_old_commit](../assets/demo/amend_old_commit-compressed.gif)

### Filter

You can filter a view with `/`. Here we filter down our branches view and then hit `enter` to view its commits.

![filter](../assets/demo/filter-compressed.gif)

### Invoke a custom command

Lazygit has a very flexible [custom command system](docs/Custom_Command_Keybindings.md). In this example a custom command is defined which emulates the built-in branch checkout action.

![custom_command](../assets/demo/custom_command-compressed.gif)

### Worktrees

You can create worktrees to have multiple branches going at once without the need for stashing or creating WIP commits when switching between them. Press `w` in the branches view to create a worktree from the selected branch and switch to it.

![worktree_create_from_branches](../assets/demo/worktree_create_from_branches-compressed.gif)

### Rebase magic (custom patches)

You can build a custom patch from an old commit and then remove the patch from the commit, split out a new commit, apply the patch in reverse to the index, and more.

In this example we have a redundant comment that we want to remove from an old commit. We hit `<enter>` on the commit to view its files, then `<enter>` on a file to focus the patch, then `<space>` to add the comment line to our custom patch, and then `ctrl+p` to view the custom patch options; selecting to remove the patch from the current commit.

Learn more in the [Rebase magic Youtube tutorial](https://youtu.be/4XaToVut_hs).

![custom_patch](../assets/demo/custom_patch-compressed.gif)

### Rebase from marked base commit

Say you're on a feature branch that was itself branched off of the develop branch, and you've decided you'd rather be branching off the master branch. You need a way to rebase only the commits from your feature branch. In this demo we check to see which was the last commit on the develop branch, then press `shift+b` to mark that commit as our base commit, then press `r` on the master branch to rebase onto it, only bringing across the commits from our feature branch. Then we push our changes with `shift+p`.

![rebase_onto](../assets/demo/rebase_onto-compressed.gif)

### Undo

You can undo the last action by pressing 'z' and redo with `ctrl+z`. Here we drop a couple of commits and then undo the actions.
Undo uses the reflog which is specific to commits and branches so we can't undo changes to the working tree or stash.

[More info](/docs/Undoing.md)

![undo](../assets/demo/undo-compressed.gif)

### Commit graph

When viewing the commit graph in an enlarged window (use `+` and `_` to cycle window sizes), the commit graph is shown. Colours correspond to the commit authors, and as you navigate down the graph, the parent commits of the selected commit are highlighted.

![commit_graph](../assets/demo/commit_graph-compressed.gif)

### Compare two commits

If you press `shift+w` on a commit (or branch/ref) a menu will open that allows you to mark that commit so that any other commit you select will be diffed against it. Once you've selected the second commit, you'll see the diff in the main view and if you press `<enter>` you'll see the files of the diff. You can press `shift+w` to view the diff menu again to see options like reversing the diff direction or exiting diff mode. You can also exit diff mode by pressing `<escape>`.

## Installation

[![Packaging status](https://repology.org/badge/vertical-allrepos/lazygit.svg)](https://repology.org/project/lazygit/versions)

_Most of the above packages are maintained by third parties so be sure to vet them yourself and confirm that the maintainer is a trustworthy looking person who attends local sports games and gives back to their communities with barbeque fundraisers etc_

### Binary Releases

For Windows, Mac OS(10.12+) or Linux, you can download a binary release [here](../../releases).

### Homebrew

Normally the lazygit formula can be found in the Homebrew core but we suggest you tap our formula to get the frequently updated one. It works with Linux, too.

Tap:

```
brew install jesseduffield/lazygit/lazygit
```

Core:

```
brew install lazygit
```

### MacPorts

Latest version built from github releases.
Tap:

```
sudo port install lazygit
```

### Void Linux

Packages for Void Linux are available in the distro repo

They follow upstream latest releases

```sh
sudo xbps-install -S lazygit
```

### Scoop (Windows)

You can install `lazygit` using [scoop](https://scoop.sh/). It's in the `extras` bucket:

```sh
# Add the extras bucket
scoop bucket add extras

# Install lazygit
scoop install lazygit
```

### Arch Linux

Packages for Arch Linux are available via pacman and AUR (Arch User Repository).

There are two packages. The stable one which is built with the latest release
and the git version which builds from the most recent commit.

- Stable: `sudo pacman -S lazygit`
- Development: <https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/lazygit-git/>

Instruction of how to install AUR content can be found here:
<https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Arch_User_Repository>

### Fedora and RHEL

Packages for Fedora/RHEL and CentOS Stream are available via [Copr](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/atim/lazygit/) (Cool Other Package Repo).

```sh
sudo dnf copr enable atim/lazygit -y
sudo dnf install lazygit
```

### Solus Linux

```sh
sudo eopkg install lazygit
```

### Ubuntu

```sh
LAZYGIT_VERSION=$(curl -s "https://api.github.com/repos/jesseduffield/lazygit/releases/latest" | grep -Po '"tag_name": "v\K[^"]*')
curl -Lo lazygit.tar.gz "https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/releases/latest/download/lazygit_${LAZYGIT_VERSION}_Linux_x86_64.tar.gz"
tar xf lazygit.tar.gz lazygit
sudo install lazygit /usr/local/bin
```

Verify the correct installation of lazygit:

```sh
lazygit --version
```

### Funtoo Linux

Funtoo Linux has an autogenerated lazygit package in [dev-kit](https://github.com/funtoo/dev-kit/tree/1.4-release/dev-vcs/lazygit):

```sh
sudo emerge dev-vcs/lazygit
```
### Gentoo Linux

Lazygit is not (yet) in main Gentoo portage, however an ebuild is available in [GURU overlay](https://github.com/gentoo-mirror/guru/tree/master/dev-vcs/lazygit)

You can either add the overlay to your system and install lazygit as usual:

```sh
sudo eselect repository enable guru
sudo emaint sync -r guru
sudo emerge dev-vcs/lazygit
```

### openSUSE

The lazygit package is currently built in [devel:languages:go/lazygit](https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/devel:languages:go/lazygit).

To install lazygit on openSUSE Tumbleweed run:

```sh
sudo zypper ar https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/devel:/languages:/go/openSUSE_Factory/devel:languages:go.repo
sudo zypper ref && sudo zypper in lazygit
```

To install lazygit on openSUSE Leap run:

```sh
source /etc/os-release
sudo zypper ar https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/devel:/languages:/go/$VERSION_ID/devel:languages:go.repo
sudo zypper ref && sudo zypper in lazygit
```

### NixOs

On NixOs lazygit is packaged with nix and distributed via nixpkgs.
You can try the lazygit without installing it with:

```sh
nix-shell -p lazygit
# or with flakes enabled
nix run nixpkgs#lazygit
```

Or you can add lazygit to you configuration.nix in the environment.systemPackages section.
More details can be found via NixOs search [page](https://search.nixos.org/).

### FreeBSD

```sh
pkg install lazygit
```

### Termux

```sh
apt install lazygit
```

### Conda

Released versions are available for different platforms, see <https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/lazygit>

```sh
conda install -c conda-forge lazygit
```

### Go

```sh
go install github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit@latest
```

Please note:
If you get an error claiming that lazygit cannot be found or is not defined, you
may need to add `~/go/bin` to your $PATH (MacOS/Linux), or `%HOME%\go\bin`
(Windows). Not to be mistaken for `C:\Go\bin` (which is for Go's own binaries,
not apps like lazygit).

### Chocolatey (Windows)

You can install `lazygit` using [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/):

```sh
choco install lazygit
```

### Winget (Windows 10 1709 or later)

You can install `lazygit` using the `winget` command in the Windows Terminal with the following command:

```powershell
winget install -e --id=JesseDuffield.lazygit
```

### Manual

You'll need to [install Go](https://golang.org/doc/install)

```
git clone https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit.git
cd lazygit
go install
```

You can also use `go run main.go` to compile and run in one go (pun definitely intended)

## Usage

Call `lazygit` in your terminal inside a git repository.

```sh
$ lazygit
```

If you want, you can
also add an alias for this with `echo "alias lg='lazygit'" >> ~/.zshrc` (or
whichever rc file you're using).

### Keybindings

You can check out the list of keybindings [here](/docs/keybindings).

### Changing Directory On Exit

If you change repos in lazygit and want your shell to change directory into that repo on exiting lazygit, add this to your `~/.zshrc` (or other rc file):

```
lg()
{
    export LAZYGIT_NEW_DIR_FILE=~/.lazygit/newdir

    lazygit "$@"

    if [ -f $LAZYGIT_NEW_DIR_FILE ]; then
            cd "$(cat $LAZYGIT_NEW_DIR_FILE)"
            rm -f $LAZYGIT_NEW_DIR_FILE > /dev/null
    fi
}
```

Then `source ~/.zshrc` and from now on when you call `lg` and exit you'll switch directories to whatever you were in inside lazygit. To override this behaviour you can exit using `shift+Q` rather than just `q`.

### Undo/Redo

## Configuration

Check out the [configuration docs](docs/Config.md).

### Custom Pagers

See the [docs](docs/Custom_Pagers.md)

### Custom Commands

If lazygit is missing a feature, there's a good chance you can implement it yourself with a custom command!

See the [docs](docs/Custom_Command_Keybindings.md)

### Git flow support

Lazygit supports [Gitflow](https://github.com/nvie/gitflow) if you have it installed. To understand how the Gitflow model works check out Vincent Driessen's original [post](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) explaining it. To view Gitflow options from within Lazygit, press `i` from within the branches view.
